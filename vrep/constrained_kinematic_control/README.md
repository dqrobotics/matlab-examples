# Constrained Kinematic Control

This example performs a constrained kinematic control using the Kuka LBR4 serial manipulator on a dynamics-enabled CoppeliaSim scene. 
The goal is to minimize the distance between the end effector and a 
target plane (green plane) while preventing collisions between the end-effector and other planes (red planes) in the workspace.
