% Example of pseudoinverse-based controller with Euclidean error calculation.
%
% CLASSIC_PSEUDOINVERSE_CONTROLLER_EXAMPLE () Runs a simple example where a
% classic controller based on the pseudoinverse of the Jacobian matrix is
% used with an Euclidean error to control different tasks based on common
% geometric primitives (pose, plane, line, translation, rotation, and
% distance).
